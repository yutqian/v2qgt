# This code is developed for calculating quantum geometric tensor directly from DFT.
* This code can be used for calculating quantum geometric tensor, including Berry curvature and quantum metric, directly by reading Wavecar of VASP. We use the kubo_formula to do the calcualtions.
The code is based on VASPBERRY: https://github.com/Infant83/VASPBERRY
