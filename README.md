# v2qgt ðŸš€  

This code **v2qgt** provides an efficient tool for calculating the **quantum geometric tensor (QGT)** directly from DFT calculations. The code is based on [VASPBERRY](https://github.com/Infant83/VASPBERRY) but includes important fixes and enhancements.  

## âœ¨ Features  
- Computes **Berry curvature** and **quantum metric tensor** directly from VASP's `WAVECAR`.  
- Implements the **Kubo formula** for accurate calculations.  
- Fixes bugs in **VASPBERRY** and extends functionality to support **both 2D and 3D materials**.  

## ðŸ”§ Installation  
Simply compile using:  
```sh
make
```
