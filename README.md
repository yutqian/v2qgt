# v2qgt
* This code is developed to calculate quantum geometric tensor (qgt) directly from DFT. The code is based on VASPBERRY: https://github.com/Infant83/VASPBERRY.

## The feature of v2qgt:
* The code can be used for calculating Berry curvature and quantum metric, directly by reading Wavecar of VASP. We use the kubo_formula to do the calculations.
* The code fixed the bug in VASPBERRY, and extended it to calculate both Berry curvature and quantum metric tensor for 2D and 3D materials.
